MapsPage is just rough work, not really part of the project. It is safe to be
deleted later on.
MapsActivity was the activity that was there before(with navigation bars). Its been removed from
the activity path for now.



Working

1. MainActivity - Select "Got to map view" to go to the map view -> Changes to TrailsActivity
2. TrailsActivity:

        1. onCreate -> Sets up the map, starts off location related stuff, creates needed buttons
                       and text views which are initially set to invisible

        2. onMapReady -> Adds markers for all the trails and shows the zoomed in version of the map
                         (specific to Bristol). Also adds marker for current location which is set
                         to be invisible. It also starts of onMarkerClickListener

        3. onMarkerClickListener -> Has if-else statements that check which kind of marker is selected:

                                         * trail -> make all trail markers invisible. Add markers
                                                    for artworks of selected trail. All relevant
                                                    buttons and textview are made visible.

                                          * artwork/currentloc -> show info window

        4. show/hide currentlocation button -> show/hide current location and zoom in/out accordingly

        5. back button -> Hide the markers for artworks and currentloc and also the buttons and
                          textview. Zoom out and show trail markers.

        6. setVisibility -> used to set visibility of buttons and text view.

        7. GetLastLocation, onPermissionRequestResult -> Current location related functions
